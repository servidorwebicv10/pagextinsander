# Extintores Santander – Corporate Website Simulation

This project is a **frontend simulation** of a real-world fire extinguisher company website called *Extintores Santander*.

It was developed to simulate a corporate e-commerce website using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Vanilla JavaScript**, including user registration, login system, shopping cart functionality, news integration, and weather API consumption.

This is a simulation project. No real payments, authentication systems, or databases are implemented.

---

## Project Overview

The website simulates:

- Corporate presentation homepage
- Product catalog with shopping cart
- Purchase form
- User registration and login (LocalStorage-based)
- News section using an external API
- Weather information using OpenWeather API

All dynamic functionality is handled using JavaScript and browser LocalStorage.

## Main Features

### Shopping Cart (LocalStorage-Based)
- Add products to cart
- Increase/decrease quantity
- Remove products
- Persist cart data using `localStorage`
- Sidebar cart interface
- Purchase simulation with success alert

### User Authentication (Simulated)
- User registration stored in `localStorage`
- Login validation against stored users
- Login state saved locally (no real backend authentication)

### News Integration
- Fetches real-time news from **NewsAPI**
- Search functionality
- Dynamic rendering of articles

### Weather Integration
- Fetches real-time weather data from **OpenWeather API**
- Displays:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - Pressure
  - Country and city

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
- LocalStorage API
- Fetch API
- NewsAPI (external API)
- OpenWeather API

## How to Run the Project

Since this is a static project, no backend or server setup is required.

### Option 1 – Using Live Server (Recommended)

1. Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select **"Open with Live Server"**

### Option 2 – Open Directly

You can open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## Important Notes

- The shopping cart does **not process real payments**
- The login system does **not connect to a database**
- All data is stored locally in the browser
- API keys are exposed because this is a learning project (not production-ready)

---

## Purpose of the Project

This project was built to:

- Practice frontend architecture
- Simulate real-world e-commerce logic
- Work with LocalStorage
- Consume external APIs
- Improve DOM manipulation skills
- Structure a multi-page website properly

---

## Possible Improvements

- Implement backend authentication (Node.js / Flask)
- Connect to a real database (MongoDB / MySQL)
- Implement JWT authentication
- Add payment gateway integration
- Improve UI/UX and responsiveness
- Deploy on GitHub Pages or Vercel
